The Canadian goose is a haunting and intriguing creature.

Known to reach wingspans of over 50 meters, and in multiple confirmed sightings, to breathe fire, the "common goose" is a near-mythical creature the abilities of which are almost completely unknown.

Goosenstein pits a harried uWaterloo stundent against an unstoppable force of nature - the majestic, terrifying _Goose_.
